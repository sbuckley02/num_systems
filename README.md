# Number Systems
I made this website out of boredom, so please don't judge it.

It serves three purposes:
1. To teach people about number systems, especially binary and hexadecimal
2. To convert a number from one number system to another
3. To perform complex calculations in any number system (between 2 and 36, that is)
